A basic and buggy viewer for images stored in [hydrus](https://hydrusnetwork.github.io/hydrus/index.html).  
It's currently a little wonky in a bunch of way because of my lack of know how with SwiftUI, pull requests welcomed!

I'd like to at some point add functionality to manage and upload to the collection, as well as some sort of cross platform port.


Usage is pretty simple:

- Open the program
- Open settings
- Put in the IP address of your hydrus client
- In the hydrus client, add an API key via request and accept
- Exit the settings and do some tag searches!
-- Search format is like so: "tag1", "tag2", "tag3"
- Notice that the program crashes when no images are returned! Like I said, a bit buggy.
